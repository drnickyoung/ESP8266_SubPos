# ESP8266_SubPos
A SubPos migration to ESP8266 IDE

I have started to work through the SubPos Node code (see subpos.org). That runs an ESP8266 (ESP12) via a PIC chip using AT commands to create a beacon frame containing location information. I am attempting to take the code and convert it to use the Arduino IDE/API and program the ESP8266 directly.

## Progress
28/7/2019 Code works and broadcasts.
